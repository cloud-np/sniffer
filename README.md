## Important Note
This project is just for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.
It is simply made for learning thats why the code is not optimized, not secure and most importantly **overengineered**.

# Sniffer

Using Rust so its BLAZING FAST! (not really) but it's fun to write in Rust.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloud-np/sniffer.git
